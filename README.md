## ðŸ“œ Notes
- The project follows a feature-based structure to enhance scalability.
- **HeroUI** is used for a better and more consistent UI experience.
- Some data has been mocked for testing purposes.
- Certain components, like the stock list, are cached since they do not change frequently.
- Real-time stock data is simulated by fetching updates every 5 seconds. However, using WebSockets would be a more efficient approach.
